        We've worked with businesses over the years as a freelancer, in-house manager and agency-based manager. 
        In a range of industries from Finance, Real Estate, E-Commerce and marketing agencies themselves. 
        There are some things that work in each situation, but I knew it could easily be so much better.
        There is a certain amount of digital leverage that's helpful before it's time / money wasting. 
        Our across the board is to save you more of both. Helping businesses with innovative solutions or 
        products get back to what they do best. Only 10 spaces at any time, for serious marketing management.

        Velocity7, our high-performance theme.
      </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="desc">
        Over our 10 years in web design we have obsessed over website performance. It seriously matters and makes 
        competing in any industry a breeze. Then came along the era of website builders and Wordpress. Although they can be 
        helpful, they will quickly leave your business trapped with their bloat. A blend between low-code and custom code. 
        High-performance code, high-converting design packed into one theme. Pay once, own forever. Infinitely extendable.
